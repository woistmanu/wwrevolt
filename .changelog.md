World Wide Revolt: Welcome to the Age of Survivors

It was a day unlike any other when the EMP struck – an event that forever changed the world. No one knows for sure whether it was an alien attack or something even more mysterious that hit Earth. What is certain is that the electromagnetic pulse crippled all modern infrastructure. Electronics, communication, economy – everything collapsed. Governments fell, and money became worthless. In this new, harsh world, only one thing matters: street credibility.

The year is 10 After the EMP. Most of humanity has vanished, victims of the chaotic times that followed. Only the strongest and most adaptable have survived. In this post-apocalyptic world, you take the stage. "World Wide Revolt" invites you to be part of a new era, where you fight for dominance not with money, but with your reputation and skills.

As a player, you enter a world full of duels and challenges. Your journey begins with creating your character. Train and develop them to excel in the arenas, where honor and respect mean everything. Here, in the remnants of our civilization, you must prove yourself and build your street credibility. The more respect you earn, the more land you can claim and the stronger your base of power will become.

But this is just the beginning. In "World Wide Revolt," you can construct over 30 different types of buildings to help you solidify your position and prepare for the upcoming first season. The first season marks the beginning of a new era, where only the best will survive and rule. Become strong, gather your resources and allies, and face the challenges this broken world has in store for you.
